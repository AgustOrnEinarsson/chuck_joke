Sample program used to show students Gradle in action. Based on [Jón Ingi's Hello World Gradle app](https://github.com/joningis/hugb_hello_world).


## Create project
- Git clone the project
- Run ``` gradle init --type java-library ``` to create basic folder structure.
- Run ``` gradle check ``` to check if everything is working as it should.

## Project content
- **build.gradle** (The gradle build file that we use)
- **gradle** (Folder containing the gradle wrapper)
- **gradlew** (Linux/Unix script to run the gradle wrapper)
- **gradlew.bat** (Windows script to run the gradle wrapper)
- **settings.gradle** (Settings file for gradle, not used in our example, can for example contain definitions if we have multiple projects)
- **src** (Source folder for our code)
